# Exercise 56

A first solution:

```lisp
(fn
  [coll]
  (letfn [(add-if-not-present 
            [acc ele]
            (if (contains? acc ele)
              acc
              (conj acc ele)))]
  (reduce add-if-not-present [] coll)))
```

Does not work because `(contains? [:a] :a)` is `false`.

[ClojureDocs][contains] explains it: 

> It's likely to surprise you for other sequences because it's about *indices* or *keys*, not *contents*:

A second solution:

```lisp
(add-if-not-present
            [acc ele]
            (if (nil? (some #{ele} acc))
              (conj acc ele)
              acc))
```

Replace the implementation of the `add-if-not-present` function
