# Exercise 56

A first solution:

```lisp
(fn
  [coll]
  (reduce (fn
            [acc ele]
            (if (contains? acc ele)
              acc
              (conj acc ele))) [] coll))
```

Does not work because `(contains? [:a] :a)` is `false`.

[ClojureDocs][contains] explains it: 

> It's likely to surprise you for other sequences because it's about *indices* or *keys*, not *contents*:
