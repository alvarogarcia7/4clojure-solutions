# Exercise 36

The problem is to solve a set of equations

```
(= 10 (let __ (+ x y)))
(= 4 (let __ (+ y z)))
(= 1 (let __ z))
```

which is equivalent to

```
10 = x + y
4 = y + z
1 = z
```

Given `let` constructions can be chained, it can be used to make the compiler solve the equations.

You have to invert the operations:

```lisp
(let [z 1
      y (- 4 z)
      x (- 10 y)]
      [x y z])
```
